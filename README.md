# DO NOT USE OUTSIDE OF EDUCATIONAL/DEMONSTRATIVE PURPOSES

This is a project for demonstration purposes only. It uses the MD5 hash algorithm intentionally *because* it is not secure, and this project is explicity ***not intended to be secure***. Additionally, *very bad* security has been implemented, again, because this is for *demonstration purposes only*, so any attempt at "security" is for illustrative purposes *only*.

Please be careful and don't go blindly copying random code off the Internet and thinking it's secure.

Also plz don't sue me. :)
